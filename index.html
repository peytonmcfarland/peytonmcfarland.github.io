  <h2>All About Me!</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;"> Hello! My name is Peyton McFarland. I am currently a junior at the University of Georgia with a major in Psychology and a minor in Human Development and Family Sciences. I love my major and Athens! I live in a house right outside of campus with three of my closest friends. One of them, Reagan, has a dog named Roux, and Emily has a cat named Redi. They are both so cute and make our house a home. Back at my parents house in Lawrenceville, my parents have two kittens that just turned two years old. Their names are Ace and Ellie and I love them so much. We rescued them when they were a couple weeks old and now they have quadrupled in size.</p>
<h5><i>Ace and Ellie</i></h5>

<p style="font-family:courier;">I grew up in Lawrenceville, Georgia for a majority of my childhood, but when I finished fifth grade, my family and I moved to Sydney, Australia. Me, my mom, my dad, and my two sisters, Alexa and Danielle, picked up everything and moved to a suburb where we went to school and made new friends. The adjustment was hard at first, but we came to love Sydney and it became our second home. Me and my sisters were the only Americans at our school so everyone wanted to hear our "accents". We only lived there for three years but it was an awesome experience. After the three years, we moved back to Lawrenceville into the same house and adjusted back into living in the United States. I have made lifelong friends and memories that I will never forget. Living on the beach was pretty cool too! ;)</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;">Growing up, me and family have always loved music. My dad plays the piano, guitar, and harmonica (usually only while he plays certain songs on the piano). In my house we have a room with his piano and all his other instruments along with pictures dedicated to his and my moms favorite artists. They have pictures of The Beatles, Elvis, and a couple of rare portraits of John Lennon. Last summer my parents bought a baby grand piano and refurbished it into a piano bar. They painted it white and put bar stools around it so that they could have family and friends over to spend quality time with and listen to music. My sister, Alexa, just recently got married and my dad played a special song for her at the wedding. I personally only know how to play a couple songs on piano but I hope to be as talented as my dad one day. </p>

<p style="font-family:courier;">Although I focus a majority of my time on my school work, this summer, along with taking summer classes, I will be working my job at Sugarloaf Country Club in Duluth, Georgia. We are always hiring and you can apply there with this link:</p>
